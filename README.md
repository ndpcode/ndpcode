Hello! I'm Novikov Dmitry.

I have been developing programs for embedded devices for several years. For STM32 and different devices with Linux.
C and C++ are my favorite programming languages. I'm learning C++. I am also interested in computer science and other programming languages. There is also a simple java android project here.
